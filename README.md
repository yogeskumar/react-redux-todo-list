# React Redux To-Do List Web App

This is a React.js web application built to demonstrate the usage of various technologies such as React.js, Redux, Redux Thunk, hooks, Material-UI (MUI), and Axios. The application fetches user data from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API and displays it on the home page. When a user clicks the "View User" button, they are redirected to a user page where specific user details are fetched from the API.
